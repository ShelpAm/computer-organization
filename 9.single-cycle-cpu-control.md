# Single-cycle CPU control

This documentation describes how to design the control unit inside CPU.

## Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

Control and status registers (CSRs) are:

*   separate from the register file (x0-x31).
*   used for monitoring the status and performance.
*   necessary for counters and timers, and communication with peripherals.

There can be up to 4096 CSRs.

They are not in the base ISA, but almost mandatory in every implementation: they
used to be in the base ISA, but they've been taken out for modularity reasons.
