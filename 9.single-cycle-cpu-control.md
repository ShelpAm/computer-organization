This documentation describes how to design the control unit inside CPU.

> Note: This is one of the implementations of control, but not the only one.

## Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

Control and status registers (CSRs) are:

*   Separate from the register file (x0-x31).
*   Used for monitoring the status and performance.
*   Necessary for counters, timers, and communication with peripherals.

There can be up to 4096 CSRs.

They are not in the base ISA, but almost mandatory in every implementation: they
used to be in the base ISA, but they've been taken out for modularity reasons.

### CSR instruction

CSR instruction format is as below.

|Type|Fields| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interval|`[31:20]`|`[19:15]`|`[14:12]`|`[11:7]`|`[6:0]`|
|Field name|csr|rs1|funct3|rd|opcode|
|Width (in bits)|12|5|3|5|7|
|Description|source/dest|source or uimmediate\[4:0]|instr.|rd|SYSTEM (1110011)|

Some of the CSR instruction examples:

*   Instructions whose operand is registers:

    |Instruction|rd|rs|Read CSR?|Write CSR?|
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    |csrrw (read write)|x0|-|no|yes|
    |csrrw|!x0|-|yes|yes|
    |csrrs/c (read set/clear)|-|x0|yes|no|
    |csrrs/c|-|!x0|yes|yes|

*   Immediate-operand variant to the instructions above:

    |Instruction|rd|uimm|Read CSR?|Write CSR?|
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    |csrrw (read write)|x0|-|no|yes|
    |csrrw|!x0|-|yes|yes|
    |csrrs/c (read set/clear)|-|0|yes|no|
    |csrrs/c|-|!0|yes|yes|

## Instruction timing

The maximum instruction frequency is the frequency of the slowest instruction,
because we can't just execute the faster ones but ignore everything else.

## Control logic design

There is a truth table, stored in **read-only memory (ROM)**, mapping
instruction to many fields, which control the connectivity of datapath.
Sometimes, these fileds depend on the content of BrEq or BrLT.

### ROM-based controller implementation

Inputs of ROM (11-bits address):

*   Certain bits of instruction\[30, 14:12, 6:2]
*   BrEq
*   BrLT

Outputs of ROM (totally 15 bits):

*   PCSel
*   ImmSel\[2:0]
*   BrUn
*   ASel
*   BSel
*   ALUSel\[3:0]
*   MemRW
*   RegWEn
*   WBSel\[1:0]

It's kind of like lookup table. It

1.  First uses a multiplexor to decode the complete instruction (32 bits) to one
    RISC-V instruction (which is also called one-hot).
2.  Then gets the **control word** for that instruction.

But there's a lot of redundancy here. Most of the items are zeros (due to the
one-hot method). Also, the cost of mapping an 11-bits address to the outputs is
significant, requiring $2^{11} \cdot 15 = 30720$ bits space of ROM. To simplify
the circuit, we don't use a multiplexor, but AND gates to generate each item of
the output bits (of the control word).
