# Storing and fetching instructions

## Load from memory to register

Use `lw`.

Exmaple:
```asm
lw x10,12(x15)
```
Explanation:

- `x10`: destination.
- `12`:  offset of base register (x15, a pointer)

Offset must be a constant known at assembly time.

## Store from register to memory

use `sw`.

Example:
```asm
sw x10,40(x15)
```
Note the order of operands is the same as `lw`.

## Byte data transfers

- load byte: `lb`
- store byte: `sb`

They have the same format as `lw` and `sw`. And they operate on the *low byte
positions*.

- **Sext** (Sign extension): preserves sign and value of a binary representation
  but to fit in extended size (often greater than original size of bits used).
  See [sext wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_extension).
- **Zext** (Zero extension): is almost the same as sext, but fills zeros
  rather than the sign of loaded byte. Use "unsigned byte" loads `lbu` for it.

> Note: All immediates in riscv is sign-extended.

In our case, use `lbu` to perform sign extension.

Note that there is no such thing like `sbu`, because that doesn't make sense.
Storing byte in memory just plucks the byte into a memory location, with no need
to extend anything.

## Replace addi

Immediates in `addi` must be **less than** 32-bits. To add a 32-bits number to a
register, we have to load it from memory and then do the addition. Like this:
```asm
lw x10, (12)x14
add x12, x12, x10
```
