# Basics

I didn't summarize this note to a specific theme.

## Registers

They are used to store words, made of flip-flops.

In risc-v-32bits, the value of first register x0 is 0, and immutable, but other
31 registers are assignable.

## How data are stored in memory—endianness

Endianness is all about what order bytes are stored in memory.

There is two mostly used endianness:

- big endian
- little endian
