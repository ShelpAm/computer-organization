# Some simple instructions

## Addition

Syntax: `add x1, x2, x3`

Equivalent in C: `x1 = x2 + x3`

## Subtraction

Syntax: `sub x1, x2, x3`

Equivalent in C: `x1 = x2 - x3`

## Calculations about immediates

Immediates are numerical constants.

They appear so often in code, so there are special instructions for them.

### Addition for immediates

Syntax: `addi x1, x2, constant`, where constant is a constant number.

### No subi for subtraction of immediations

Why?

Because we can simply convert the subi to addi by negating the last parameter
(the numerical constant).
