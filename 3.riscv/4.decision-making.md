# Decision making

This passage talks about branching in computer.

## *If* equivalent for RISC-V

`beq reg1, reg2, L1` means: go to statement labeled L1, if value in reg1 equals
to value in reg2.

Types of branch:

- Conditional branch—change control flow depending on outcome of comparison:
  - `beq` for *branch if equal*.
  - `bne` for *branch if not equal*.
  - `blt` for *branch if less than*.
  - `bge` for *branch if greater than or equal*.
  - `bltu` and `bgeu`, unsigned versions of `blt` and `bge`.
- Unconditional branch—always branch:
  - `j` for *jump*, as in `j label`.

Note: no `bgt` or`ble` because they can be replaced with other instructions.

## *Loop* equvalent for RISC-V

Just use conditional branching.

Example:
```cpp
for (int i{}; i != 20; ++i) {
  // ...
}
```
is equal to
```asm
addi x9,x0,20 # load 20 to x9
add x10,x0,x0 # initialize i to 0
Loop:
  beq x10,x9,Done
  # ...
  addi x10,x10,1
  j Loop
Done:
```
