# Logical instructions

## Logical add, or, xor

There are two variants of them:
- Register: `add x5, x6, x7       # x5 = x6 & x7`.
- Immediate: `addi x5, x6, 3     # x5 = x6 & 3`.

**Note: No *logical not*, as we don't need it. Use `xor` with 0b11111111.**

## Logical shifting

Instructions for logical shifting:
- `sll`: shift left logical
- `slli`: shift left logical for immediates
- `srl`: shift right logical
- `srli`: shift right logical for immediates

## Arithmetic shifting

They keep the sign while shift bits to right.

Instructions for arithmetic shifting:
- `sra`
- `srai`

For example, the value of x10 after executing the following piece of code:
```asm
addi x10, x0, 0b11100111 # 0b1110'0111
srai x10, x10, 4
```
is 0b1111'1110.

**Note: There is no `sla` or `slai`, because they don't make sense.**
