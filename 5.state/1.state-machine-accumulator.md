# State

[TOC]

This chapter descibes stateful circuits.

## Terminologies

Before learning this chapter, you should first know the following list of
terminologies:
*   Feedback, a phenomena where the outputs of a circuits are rounded back as
    its inputs.

## State machine accumulator

![A-failure-accumulator](failure-accumulator.png "A failure accumulator")

Such a circuit doesn't work because:
*   There is nothing to control the iteration of the `for` loop.
*   We can't initialize the sum (to be 0).

So we need a register to hold the value.

## Register details: flip-flops

Explanations:
*   Flip-flop name because the outoput flips and flops between 0 and 1.
*   In D-type Flip-Flop:
    *   CLK is "clock", used to load values.
    *   D is "data"; Q is "output" (quiescent, stable).

### The timinig of a d-type flip-flop

See [the timing of a d-type flip-flop](./timing-of-d-flip-flop.md).

## Pipelining

It's all about spliting and delegating works to different workers.

Extra registers are often added to help speed up the clock rate. Make a
comparison between the following two circuits, and imagine we have a lot of
works to do, continuously feeding the circuits:

*   Circuit 1: input-A-B-output
*   Circuit 2: input-A-registerX-B-registerY-output

In Circuit 1, the delay is `delayA + delayB`. And since we have registerX and
registerY in Circuit 2, to memorize the output of previous steps' calculation,
the delay of the circuit is $\max \{delayA, delayB\}$. This design results in a
significant reduction in overall delay.

## Synchronous system

### Finite state machine

The definition of finite state machine (FSM) can be found at
[Wikipedia][finite-state-machine]. But generally speaking, it's a system of
states and transitions (between states).
