# Switch

## Terminologies
- Opening and closing:
    - Closing a switch means connecting the circuit.
    - Opening a switch means disconnecting the circuit.
- Basic gates:
    - AND gate
    - OR gate

## 
- CMOS is Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor, which consists of:
    - NMOS (N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor). High voltage gives closed switch.
    - PMOS (P-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor). High voltage gives opened switch.
