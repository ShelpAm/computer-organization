# Performance

This document talks about performance and its measures.

## Performance measures

There are many performance measures, including:

*   **Response time**: the time between the start and the end of execution of a instruction.
*   **Instructions per unit time**: the number of instruction executed per unit time.
*   **Energy**: energy consumption for completing a task.

> Note that we don't use **power** as a measure of performance. Even low power CPU
> may consume much more energy because they run tasks slower.

## Processor performance iron law

$\frac{Time}{Program}$ can be broken down to three metrics:

$$\frac{Time}{Program}=\frac{Instructions}{Program}\cdot\frac{Cycles}{Instruction}\cdot\frac{Time}{Cycle}$$

, where

*   **I** = $\frac{Instructions}{Program}$ is determined by:
    *   Task
    *   Algorithm, e.g. _O(N<sup>2</sup>)_ vs _O(N)_
    *   Programming language
    *   Compiler (better compiler generates less instructions)
    *   Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
*   **C** = $\frac{Cycles}{Instruction}$ (**Cycles per Instruction, CPI**) is determined by:
    *   ISA
    *   Processor implementation, e.g. for "our" single-cycle RISC-V design, CPI = 1
    *   Complex instructions (e.g. `strcpy`), CPI >> 1
    *   [Superscalar processors](#), CPI < 1
*   **T** = $\frac{Time}{Cycle}$ (**Time per Cycle, 1 / Frequency**) depends on:
    *   Processor microarchitecture (determintes critical path through logic gates)
    *   Technology (e.g. 5nm versus 28nm)
    *   Power budget (lower voltages reduce transistor speed)

### Speed tradeoff example

For some task (e.g. image compression) ...

|Measure|Processor A|Processor B|
|---|---|---|
|\#Instructions|1 Millon|1.5 Millon|
|Average CPI|2.5|1|
|Clock rate _f_|2.5 GHz|2GHz|
|Execution time|1 ms|0.75 ms|

Though B performs worse in some items (\#Instructions and Clock rate _f_), B wins
because it has a smaller execution time.

## Energy efficiency

### Energy per task

Energy per task can be broken down into:

$$\frac{Energy}{Program}=\frac{Instructions}{Program}\cdot\frac{Energy}{Instruction}$$
$$\implies\frac{Energy}{Program}\alpha\frac{Instructions}{Program}\cdot CV^2$$

For a circuit, its total energy cost is $CV^2$, where, because of the leakage,
useful energy takes up part of them, propotional to $CV^2$.

### Energy iron law

The energy iron law:

$$Performance = Power \cdot Energy\ Efficiency$$

Namely

$$Tasks / Second = (Joules / Second) \cdot (Tasks / Joule)$$

So on the constraint of limited power, we can improve performance by improving
energy efficiency.
