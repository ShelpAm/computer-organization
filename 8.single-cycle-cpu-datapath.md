# Single-cycle CPU datapath

This documentation describes how to design the datapath inside CPU.

## RISC-V processor design

New-school machine emphasizes on *parallelism*.

### Great idea #1: **Abstraction** (Levels of representation/interpretation)

From high level to low level:

*   High level language program (e.g., C)
    *   Compiler
*   Assembly language program (e.g., RISC-V)
    *   Assembler
*   Machine language program (RISC-V)
*   Hardware architecture description (e.g., block diagrams)
*   Logic circuit description (e.g., circuit schematic diagrams)

### The CPU

*   Processor (CPU): the active part of the computer that does all the work
    (data manipulation and decision-making).
*   Datapath: portion of the processor that contains hardware necessary to
    perform operations required by the processor (the brawn).
*   Control: portion of the processor (also in hardware) that tells the datapath
    what needs to be done (the brain).

## Building a RISC-V processor

We can view CPU design as state machine design.

### Five stages of the datapath

1.  Instruction Fetch (IF) - happens in current rising edge
2.  Instruction Decode (ID)
3.  Execute (EX) - ALU
4.  Memory Access (MEM)
5.  Write Back to Register (WB) - happens in next rising edge

Note that 1. and 5. are running in the mean time!

### Register

A collection of flip-flops.

Three in's:

*   Write Enable (WE)
*   Data In
*   CLK

And one out:

*   Data Out

### Register file

A collection of registers.

## ???

... A lot of missing here.

## All datapaths to support instructions of 6 different types

### R-type datapath

### I-type datapath

### S-type datapath

### B-type datapath

#### Adding `jalr` to datapath

### J-type datapath

### U-type datapath

This is for upper-immediates (higher 20 bits, UI). Instructions to be supported:
`lui` (load upper-immediates) and `auipc` (add upper-immediates program counter)
