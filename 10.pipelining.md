# Pipelining

This document talks about performance measures, and pipelining.

## Performance measures

There are many performance measures, including:

*   **Response time**: the time between the start and the end of execution of a
    instruction.

*   **Instructions per unit time**: the number of instruction executed
    per unit time.

*   **Energy**: energy consumption for completing a task.

Note that we don't use **power** as a measure of performance. Even low power CPU
may consume much more energy because they run tasks slower.

## Processor performance iron law

$\frac{Time}{Program}=\frac{Instructions}{Program}\cdot\frac{Cycles}{Instruction}\cdot\frac{Time}{Cycle}$

From the formula above, we can see that $\frac{Time}{Program}$ is broken down to
three metrics.

*   **I** = $\frac{Instructions}{Program}$ is determined by:

    *   Task
    *   Algorithm, e.g. _O(N<sup>2</sup>)_ vs _O(N)_
    *   Programming language
    *   Compiler (better compiler generates less instructions)
    *   Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

*   **C** = $\frac{Cycles}{Instruction}$ (**Cycles per Instruction, CPI**) is
    determined by:

    *   ISA
    *   Processor implementation, e.g. for "our" single-cycle RISC-V design, CPI
        = 1
    *   Complex instructions (e.g. `strcpy`), CPI >> 1
    *   [Superscalar processors](#), CPI < 1

*   **T** = $\frac{Time}{Cycle}$ (**Time per Cycle, 1 / Frequency**) depends on:

    *   Processor microarchitecture (determintes critical path through logic
        gates)
    *   Technology (e.g. 5nm versus 28nm)
    *   Power budget (lower voltages reduce transistor speed)

### Speed tradeoff example

For some task (e.g. image compression) ...

||Processor A|Processor B|
|---|---|---|
|\#Instructions|1 Millon|1.5 Millon|
|Average CPI|2.5|1|
|Clock rate _f_|2.5 GHz|2GHz|
|Execution time|1 ms|0.75 ms|
