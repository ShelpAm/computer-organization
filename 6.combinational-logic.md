## Truth tables

|a|b|c|d|y|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|0|0|0|F(0,0,0,0)|
|0|0|0|1|F(0,0,0,1)|
|0|0|1|0|F(0,0,1,0)|
|0|0|1|1|F(0,0,1,1)|
|0|1|0|0|F(0,1,0,0)|
|0|1|0|1|F(0,1,0,1)|
|0|1|1|0|F(0,1,1,0)|
|0|1|1|1|F(0,1,1,1)|
|1|0|0|0|F(1,0,0,0)|
|1|0|0|1|F(1,0,0,1)|
|1|0|1|0|F(1,0,1,0)|
|1|0|1|1|F(1,0,1,1)|
|1|1|0|0|F(1,1,0,0)|
|1|1|0|1|F(1,1,0,1)|
|1|1|1|0|F(1,1,1,0)|

Example: iff one (not both) a,b=1

|a|b|y|

|1|1|0|

## Logic gates

*   AND: both one
*   OR: at least one (inclusive OR)
*   NOT: flip the input
*   XOR: exclusive OR
    > Note: In N-input XOR, the result is the number of 1s in the input, mod 2.
*   NAND
*   NOR

Logic gates and truth tables can be converted (mapped) **bidirectionally**.

## Boolean algebra

It's a math branch that studies calculation of 0 and 1.

We can use it to simplify our circuits, and thus to determine if two circuits
are identical.

### Operations on 0s and 1s

We have *add* (`+`, whose rule is like OR) and *times* (`*`, whose rule is like
AND). And you don't have to write `*` (*times*) out explicitly.

### Laws of boolean algebra

*   Complementarity
    *   $x * \overline{x} = 0$
    *   $x + \overline{x} = 1$
*   Laws of 0's and 1's
    *   $x * 0 = 0$
    *   $x + 1 = 1$
*   Identities
    *   $x * 1 = x$
    *   $x + 0 = x$
*   Idempotent law
    *   $x * x = x$
    *   $x + x = x$
*   Communitive law
    *   $x * y = y * x$
    *   $x + y = y + x$
*   Associativity
    *   $(xy)z = x(yz)$
    *   $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$
*   Distribution
    *   $x(y + z) = xy + xz$
    *   $x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)$
*   Uniting theorem
    *   $xy + x = x$
    *   $(x + y)x = x$
*   DeMorgan's Law
    *   $\overline{x * y} = \overline{x} + \overline{y}$
    *   $\overline{(x + y)} = \overline{x} * \overline{y}$
    *   NOT inverts everybody including the operator ðŸ˜‚

## Canonical forms

Use some (exactly one) representative form to represent truth table.

The algorithm to get canonical form (**Sum of products**, or **ORs of ANDs**):

1.  For every row of y being 1:
1.  If and only if a=xxx, b=yyy, and c=zzz and so on, y is 1. So *add* this
    expression to the complete formula.
1.  And the form of result should be something like $y =
    \overline{a}\overline{b}c + \overline{a}bc + ab\overline{c}$.

After getting the canonical form, you can reduce it to the minimal expression
(with boolean algebra).
