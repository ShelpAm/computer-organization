# Signals and waveforms: circuit delay

Real world circuits have delays!

If the delay is from an adder, it's called adder propagation delay. If the delay
is from an AND gate, it's called AND propagation delay.

## Terminologies
- Rising edge (also called positive edge)—the edge that rises in the waveform
- Falling edge—the edge that falls in the waveform.

## Type of circuits
There're two basic types of circuits:
- *Combinational Logic (CL) Circuits*
    - Our previous adder circuit is an example.
    - Output is a function of the inputs **only**.
    - Similar to a pure function in mathematics, y = f(x). (No way to store
    information from one invocation to the next. No side effects)
- *State Elements*
    - circuits that store information
    - **Circuits with state** (e.g., registers)

## In conclusion
- Clocks control pulse of our circuits.
- Voltages are analog, quantized to 0/1.
- Circuit delays are fact of life
- Two types of circuits:
    - Stateless Combinational Logic (&,|,~)
    - State circuits (e.g., registers)
